# Keystone-Project
Project was used to put togather what I learned for my associate degree at lonestar

My idea for this project was to help automate some of the calculations for accountants, such as payroll tax. While some states have similar rules, they still vary so I made a generic program that can be easily modified without much trouble.

The second step after it does the calculation is to save the information into a spreadsheet again to lessen the chance of human error if they had to copy the data from the calculator into the spreadsheet manually.

once you hit the submit button it does the calculations and then you hit the save button to make it into a spreadsheet

My goal was to demonstrate the importance of integrating security measures early in the software development process to prevent issues down the line. In my program, I implemented input validation using regular expressions to restrict values in each section, ensuring that only appropriate data is accepted. If the input fails validation, an error is triggered. While this approach isn't foolproof, it adds an additional layer of protection to help safeguard users' data.
