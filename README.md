# Keystone-Project
Project was used to put togather what I learned for my associate degree at lonestar

My idea for this project was to help automate some of the calculations for accountants, such as payroll tax. While some states have similar rules, they still vary so I made a generic program that can be easily modified without much trouble.

The second step after it does the calculation is to save the information into a spreadsheet again to lessen the chance of human error if they had to copy the data from the calculator into the spreadsheet manually.

once you hit the submit button it does the calculations and then you hit the save button to make it into a spreadsheet

Overall the program works as a proof of concept but wouldn't recommend for real use.
